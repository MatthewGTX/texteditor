A command-based text editor I made a few weeks since I started learning C. It supports appending, inserting, changing, and deleting lines.
It can also print the contents of a line or searching for the first occurrence of a text. Changes must be written to the file with 'w'. 
It works by copying the file into a linked list (if opening an existing file) and then writing the linked list back to the file.
